# A Simple Weather App
A simple weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and Deniz Fuchidzhiev's icon fonts (http://websygen.github.io/owfont/).</br></br>
The app shows the current weather in the selected city. The user can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit degrees.
