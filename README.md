# A Simple Weather App
A simple weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) and Deniz Fuchidzhiev's icon fonts (http://websygen.github.io/owfont/).</br></br>
The app shows the current weather in the selected city. The user can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit degrees.

## Goal
The app was created to practice using Ajax APIs with jQuery. Additionally, Pug was added to play around with an HTML preprocessor.

## Using
Run </br></br>
`git clone https://github.com/NancyBabich/weather-app`</br></br>
`npm install`</br></br>
and </br></br>
`npm run start`</br></br>
The app will be available under localhost:3000.
